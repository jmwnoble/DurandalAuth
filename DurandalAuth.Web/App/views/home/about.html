                    <h3>Who we are and what we're about</h3>
                    <p>
                        We are dedicated to creating simple and beautifully designed tools that become part of the organisational experience in order to unlock the latent potential of feedback and human insight to improve business performance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To achieve this, we draw on our combined experience in strategy consulting, technology, organisational psychology and leadership, complemented by a passion for agile methodologies and doing things differently.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We believe in being strategic yet pragmatic, experimental yet evidence-based, focused yet adaptive.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our tools are designed specifically for organisations who want to embrace new ways of doing things, believe in continuous adaptation and improvement, and want to bring their staff on that journey. Does this sound like you?
