                <p>
                    A CueZero is the earliest cue or signal about a new risk, opportunity or strength in your organization.
                    It comes from human insight, observation and experience, and is captured in the form of feedback.
                    If you’re not paying attention, you might just miss it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It’s CueZero’s job to make sure that you don’t miss these cues.
                    It means that you can make the most of an opportunity or course-correct if things are going off track, before it’s too late.
